    VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) levels represent the concentration of
    certain chemicals in the air. High VOC levels suggest poor indoor air
    quality and can be caused by many sources, such as cleaning supplies,
    paint, and furnishings.

    The specific effects of VOC exposure can vary greatly from person to
    person, but high levels can cause symptoms like headaches, dizziness,
    and even long-term health effects. Many studies suggest that keeping
    VOC levels under 200 μg/m³ can mitigate these effects, although this
    is not a strict limit.

    Levels over 500 μg/m³ are often associated with more severe health
    effects in various studies. However, there is no universally agreed
    upon threshold for dangerous VOC levels.

    This scale caps at 1000 μg/m³, as this level would suggest very poor
    indoor air quality. Extreme VOC levels, such as those over 5000 μg/m³,
    are indicative of a severe lack of ventilation and are associated with
    major health risks, although such high levels are not typically
    encountered in residential settings.
